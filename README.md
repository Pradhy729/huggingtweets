# HuggingTweets - Train a model to generate tweets

I modified Boris Dayma's original huggingtweets repo and played around with building an app using the awesome [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) tool. See the screencast below to see what the app can do. It is a work in progress - I will hopefully deploy it as a website at some point.

Credit goes to [Boris Dayma](https://github.com/borisdayma) for the original repo that this was forked from. 
I also made use of the [simpletransformers](https://github.com/ThilinaRajapakse/simpletransformers) library by [Thillina Rajapakse](https://github.com/ThilinaRajapakse/simpletransformers) to download, train and use the pretrained GPT2 model.
