# HuggingTweets - Train a model to generate tweets

I modified Boris Dayma's original huggingtweets repo and played around with building an app using the awesome [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) tool. See the screencast below to see what the app can do. It is a work in progress - I will hopefully deploy it as a website at some point.
